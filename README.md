## Development & Build 

The App is tested on macOS Sonoma and should run on Windows (and probably Linux) as well.

To develop or extend the App you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
Run `npm i` to install necessary packages and `npm run dev` to launch the app in development mode.
